classes:
  # base
  - name: MassRateModelSettings
    short_summary: "Functional base class to define settings for mass rates."
    extended_summary: |
      Base class for providing settings for a mass rate model, that defines the models to be used to numerically propagate the
      mass of a body during a simulation. If any additional information (besides the type of the mass rate model) is required,
      these must be implemented in a derived class (dedicated for each mass rate model type).

    methods:
      - name: ctor # [cpp]
        short_summary: "Constructor." # [cpp]
        extended_summary: "Instances of this class are typically not generated by the user because this is a base class." # [cpp]


  # derived (1)
  - name: FromThrustMassRateSettings
    short_summary: "`MassRateModelSettings`-derived class to define settings for a mass rate model derived from a thrust model."
    extended_summary: |
      `MassRateModelSettings`-derived class to define settings for a mass rate model derived from a thrust model.

    methods:
      - name: ctor # [cpp]
        short_summary: "Constructor." # [cpp]
        extended_summary: "Instances of this class are typically not generated by the user. Settings objects for torques should be instantiated through the factory functions of a derived class." # [cpp]


  # derived (2)
  - name: CustomMassRateSettings
    short_summary: "`MassRateModelSettings`-derived class to define settings for a custom mass rate model."
    extended_summary: |
      `MassRateModelSettings`-derived class to define settings for a custom mass rate model.

    methods:
      - name: ctor # [cpp]
        short_summary: "Constructor." # [cpp]
        extended_summary: "Instances of this class are typically not generated by the user. Settings objects for torques should be instantiated through the factory functions of a derived class." # [cpp]

functions:

  # factory functions

  # From thrust
  - name: fromThrustMassRate # [cpp]
  - name: from_thrust # [py]
    short_summary: "Creates the settings for a mass rate model defined from a thrust model."
    extended_summary: |
      Creates the settings for a mass rate model defined from a thrust model. The mass rate model is derived from
      the associated body's engine model. It is possible to consider only a specific engine or all engines.

    parameters:
      - name: useAllThrustModels # [cpp]
        type: bool, default=true # [cpp]
      - name: use_all_thrust_models # [py]
        type: bool, default=true # [py]
        description: Denotes whether all engines of the associated body are to be combined into a single thrust model.

      - name: associatedThrustSource # [cpp]
        type: std::string, default="" # [cpp]
      - name: associated_thrust_source # [py]
        type: str, default="" # [py]
        description: Name of engine model from which thrust is to be derived (must be empty if the first argument is set to true).

    returns:
        type: FromThrustMassRateSettings
        description: From thrust mass rate settings object.


  # Custom
  - name: customMassRate # [cpp]
  - name: custom # [py]
    short_summary: "Creates the settings for a mass rate model defined from a thrust model."
    extended_summary: |
      Creates the settings for a custom mass rate model defined through a mass rate function. The function must have
      time as an independent variable.

    parameters:
      - name: massRateFunction # [cpp]
        type: std::function<double(double)> # [cpp]
      - name: mass_rate_function # [py]
        type: callable[[float], float] # [py]
        description: Function of time defining the custom mass rate.

    returns:
        type: CustomMassRateSettings
        description: Custom mass rate settings object.
