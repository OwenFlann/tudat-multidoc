    short_summary: "Creates the settings for the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton integrator."
    extended_summary: |
      Factory function to create settings for the Adams-Bashforth-Moulton integrator.
      For this integrator, the step size is varied based on the tolerances and safety factor provided.
      The tolerance is composed of an absolute and a relative part.
