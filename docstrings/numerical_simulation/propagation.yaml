summary : "Functionalities and utilities of propagation objects."

extended_summary: |
  This module provides functionalities for propagation settings
  objects. It also contains some utility functions that extract specific quantities from propagation settings and body
  objects.

enums:
  - name: PropagationTerminationReason
    short_summary: "Enumeration of types of termination of propagation."

    members:
      - name: propagation_never_run
      - name: unknown_reason
      - name: termination_condition_reached
      - name: runtime_error_caught_in_propagation
      - name: nan_or_inf_detected_in_state

classes:

  - name: PropagationTerminationDetails
    short_summary: |
       Object that provides information on the reason for the
       termination of the propagation.

    properties: # [py]
      - name: termination_reason # [py]
        type: PropagationTerminationReason # [py]
        description: | # [py]
          Enum defining the reason the propagation was terminated

      - name: terminated_on_exact_condition # [py]
        type: bool # [py]
        description: | # [py]
          Boolean defining whether the propagation was terminated on an *exact* final condition,
          or once the propagation went *past* the determined final condition. The choice of behaviour is
          defined by the termination settings provided as input to the Simulator object.

functions:


  - name: getInitialStatesOfBodies # [cpp]
  - name: get_state_of_bodies # [py]

        type: std::vector<std::string> # [cpp]
      - name: central_bodies # [py]
        type: list[str] # [py]
        description: List of central bodies, each referred to a body being propagated (in the same order).

  # Free function
  - name: createCombinedInitialState # [cpp]
  - name: combine_initial_states # [py]
    short_summary: "Function to retrieve the initial state for a list of propagator settings."
    extended_summary: |
      Function to retrieve the initial state for a list of propagator settings. This way, the initial state for
      different quantities to be propagated (e.g., translational state, rotational state, mass) are retrieved and
      organized in a single container.

    parameters:

        description: Propagator settings where the type of propagation is reported as key and the respective list of propagator settings as value.

    returns:
        type: Eigen::Matrix # [cpp]
        type: numpy.ndarray # [py]
        description: Vector of initial states, sorted in order of IntegratedStateType, and then in the order of the vector of SingleArcPropagatorSettings of given type.
