    short_summary: "Function to propagate system formal errors through time."
    extended_summary: |
      Function to propagate the formal errors of a given system through time.
      Note that in practice the entire covariance matrix is propagated, but only the formal errors (variances) are reported at the output times.
      The system dynamics and numerical settings of the propagation are prescribed by the `state_transition_interface` parameter.
